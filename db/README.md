# Database directory

Each time 10 rows are included as the static data for the API. We cannot distribute the raw data as this is not allowed by De Lijn, neither allowed by MIVB/STIB. If you are an iRail member and you don't have the credentials to the FTP, you can drop Yeri a note: yeri a≈ß iRail.be.

## Getting started:

Execute the SQL queries in this directory to your database
